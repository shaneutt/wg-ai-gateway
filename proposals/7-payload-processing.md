# Payload Processing

* Authors: @shaneutt, @kflynn

# What?

Define standards for declaratively adding processing steps to HTTP requests and
responses in Kubernetes across the entire payload, including the body.

# Why?

Modern workloads require the ability to process the full payload of an HTTP
request and response, including both header and body:

* **AI Inference Security**: Guard against bad prompts for inference requests,
  or misaligned responses.
* **AI Inference Optimization**: Route requests based on semantics. Enable
  caching based on semantic similarity to reduce inference costs and enable
  faster response times for common requests. Enable RAG systems to supplement
  inference requests with additional context to get better results.
* **Web Application Security**: Enforce signature-based detection rules, anomaly
  detection systems, scan uploads, call external auth with payload data, etc.

Payload processing can also encompass various use cases outside of AI, such as
external authorization or rate limiting. Despite these use cases, though,
payload processing is not standardized in Kubernetes today.

## Definitions

* **Payload Processors**: Features capable of processing the full payload of
  requests and/or responses (including headers and body). Payload processors
  may be implemented natively or as extensions. Many existing API gateways
  (including Envoy and NGINX) include filter mechanisms which fit this
  definition, but we are not limiting discussion to only these existing
  mechanisms.

## User Stories

* As a developer of an application that performs AI inference as part of its
  function:

   * I want routing decisions for inference requests to be able to be
     dynamically adapted based on the content of each request, targeting the
     most suitable models to improve the quality of inference results that my
     application receives.

   * I want declarative configuration of failure modes for processing steps
     (fail-open, fail-closed, fallback, etc) to ensure safe and efficient
     runtime behavior of my application.

   * I want predictable ordering of all payload processing steps to ensure
     safe and consistent runtime behavior.

* As a security engineer, I want to be able to add a detection engine which
  scans requests to identify malicious or anomalous request payloads and
  block, sanitize, and/or report them before they reach backends.

* As a cluster admin, I want to be able to add semantic caching to inference
  requests in order to detect repeated requests and return cached results,
  reducing overall inference costs and improving latency for common requests.

* As a compliance officer:

   * I want to be able to add processors that examine inference **requests**
     for personally identifiable information (PII) so that any PII can result
     in the request being blocked, sanitized, or reported before sending it to
     the inference backend.

   * I want to be able to add processors that examine inference **responses**
     for malicious or misaligned results so that any such results can be
     dropped, sanitized, or reported before the response is sent to the
     requester.

## Goals

* Ensure that declarative APIs, standards, and guidance on best practices
  exist for adding Payload Processors to HTTP requests and responses on
  Kubernetes.
* Ensure that there is adequate documentation for developers to be able to
  easily build implementations of Payload Processors according to the
  standards.
* Support composability, pluggability, and ordered processing of Payload
  Processors.
* Ensure the APIs can provide clear and easily observable defaulting behavior.
* Ensure the APIs can provide clear and obvious runtime behavior.
* Provide failure mode options for Payload Processors.

## Non-Goals

* Requiring every request or response to be processed by a payload processor.
  The mechanisms described in this proposal are intended to be optional
  extensions.
